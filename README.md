# MoyaiTEST | Version 0.9 Beta
MoyaiTEST is a Discord Bot made in Python. It is the testing bot to our main bot, Moyai. Our testing bot will provide tests to newly added functions. Some functions may or may not work.

# Future Expectations
... to be updated

# Current Time
With version 0.9, we are migrating our slash commands to become part of our GUI interface. We are trying to limit & reduce the amount of slash commands Moyai currently has. This makes the interaction more friendly for users. As of right now, only the "Help Manager" & the "Fun Manager" are part of our GUI interface. With the limited resources Discord.py 2.0 has to offer, we are trying to create the best known GUI interface we can. Down below, you will see the "Fun Manager" & "Help Manager". The commands stated below will not be altered. The title of category will be changed with the slash command that has to be executed to interact & execute our functions.
