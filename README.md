# Current Repository Updates | Version 1.0

# MoyaiGUI | Version 1.0
Introducing MoyaiGUI, our cutting-edge graphical user interface designed to seamlessly integrate with Discord and the latest version of its Python Library. Although the current limitations of Discord.py 2.0 may result in a modest design, our interface is regularly updated to ensure optimal functionality and relevancy.

MoyaiGUI features five utility managers that efficiently categorize and execute functions. Additionally, our help management utility serves as a comprehensive guide, providing users with access to all management utilities and their respective functions. With MoyaiGUI, users can effortlessly navigate and utilize the full range of features available to them.
